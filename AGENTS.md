using macroquad, and [synth-ui-style.png 1246x946] create a new rust project called miniroog-model-r, run git init so we have a git starting point, and then follow minimoog-panel.gif as the plan for the gui for the top half. for the bottom half it should be rounded squares imitating a keyboard in vintage amber 1px wide style. for the white keys (bottom row)  use these: zxcvbnm,./ for the black keys use these sd ghj l; ']\ in each square include the letter proportional centered. it will be monophonic but we want to leave the door open to do polyphonic later. you'll need to setup three vco oscilators using tokio and probably std::sync::mpsc as your goroutines and channels to share data. let's preserve the concept of voltage control. this should all be 1280x720; in a seperate window 400x400 on the top include a waveform thing and in the bottom do a frequency analyzer for debugging. if the window is closed there should be a "debugger" button you can press to reopen it. it should be same 1px amber style macroquad. if you want a guide on how to do the draw, there's an example over in /Users/chedstrom/github/voyager_paths. this should be a toy app and minimal, split out the neccessary components e.g. vco.rs, controllers.rs (which probably consumes vco.rs), oscillatorbank.rs, mixer.rs, modifiers.rs, outpout.rs. it should generate audio i can hear on my laptop speakers at an acceptable volume
