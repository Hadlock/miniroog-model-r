error: failed to select a version for `quad-alsa-sys`.
    ... required by package `quad-snd v0.2.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `quad-snd = "^0.2"` of package `macroquad v0.4.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `macroquad = "^0.4"` of package `miniroog-model-r v0.1.0 (/Users/chedstrom/github/miniroog-model-r)`
versions that meet the requirements `^0.3.2` are: 0.3.2

the package `quad-alsa-sys` links to the native library `alsa`, but it conflicts with a previous package which links to `alsa` as well:
package `alsa-sys v0.3.1`
    ... which satisfies dependency `alsa-sys = "^0.3.1"` of package `alsa v0.7.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `alsa = "^0.7"` of package `cpal v0.15.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `cpal = "^0.15"` of package `miniroog-model-r v0.1.0 (/Users/chedstrom/github/miniroog-model-r)`
Only one package in the dependency graph may specify the same links value. This helps ensure that only one copy of a native library is linked in the final binary. Try to adjust your dependencies so that only one package uses the `links = "alsa"` value. For more information, see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#links.
